#1. Project Background and Description
-The goal is to have a player play a game against the dealer. The dealer draws 2 cards but does not reveal the total until the Player gets their total. 
-Then the player receives 2 cards, they then can determine if they like to hit(gain another card) or stand(hold their cards). 
-If the player has a total over 21 they lose. If the dealer has a total over 21 and the player a total is under 21 the player wins. 
-If the player and the dealer both have a total under 21 the player or dealer with the total value closest to 21 wins. 

#2.Implementation Plan:
-The following tools we will be using for this project will be netBeans.
-We have created a remote repository that is located in the link above. 
-The coding standard we implemented is proper naming convention of the classes, method, variables, and etc. 
-We also plan to keep a neat file management, meaning that we will commit only necessary changes and create branches in the repo to track our changes. 
-We will also implement correct formation, commenting, and documentation.
